# Reference:


## `area_of_rectangle()` 
### Function Purpose:
The 'area_of_rectangle()' function calculates the area of a rectagle when given the width and height of the rectanlge of interest. 
### Function Inputs & Outputs
'area_of_rectangle()' takes in two inputs: **height** and **width**. These inputs can be either of type **integer** or type **float**, either works. The output is the product of the two inputs and is returned as the utilized type of the inputs.

## `perimeter_of_rectangle()` 
### Function Purpose:
The 'perimeter_of_rectangle()' function calculates the perimeter of a rectagle when given the width and height of the rectanlge of interest. 
### Function Inputs & Outputs
'perimeter_of_rectangle()' takes in two inputs: **height** and **width**. These inputs can be either of type **integer** or type **float**, either works. The output is the perimeter of the rectangle, which can be represented by the equation: **P = 2(width+height)**.

## `my_adder()` 
### Function Purpose:
The 'my_adder()' function is designed to sum three numbers and return the solved output.

### Function Inputs & Outputs
'my_adder()' takes in three numbers as type **float** or type **integer**, and outputs a single number representing the sum of the three with the same type as the inputs. 

## `my_thermo_stat()` 
### Function Purpose
The 'my_thermo_stat()' function handles the status of a thermostat. It is designed to recognize when the temperature fluctutates too far (+ or - 5 degrees) in either direction from an established set point, and react accordingly. 

### Function Inputs & Outputs
'my_thermo_stat()' takes in two inputs, both as type **integer**. The first input is the measured or current temperature, and the second input is the desired temperature. The output is of type **string**, and simply states the status of the thermostat (**Heat**, **AC**, or **off**).

## `have_digits()` 
### Function Purpose
The 'have_digits' function is tasked with determining if a number is present in a string of interest.

### Function Inputs & Outputs
'have_digit' takes in one singlular input with type **string**, and an unrestricted length. If the string does not have a number present, the resulting output will be **0**. If the string does have a number embedded within it, the resulting output will be a **1**.
